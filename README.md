- **KMeans.py:** K-Means and K-Means++ clustering algorithms for partitioning data into clusters.

### Preprocessing

- **LabelEncoder.py:** Encode categorical labels into numerical indices and vice versa.
- **Normalizer.py:** Normalize data using 'minmax' or 'mean' strategy.
- **OneHotEncoder.py:** Convert categorical labels into one-hot encoded vectors.
- **SimpleImputer.py:** Impute missing values using 'mean', 'median', 'most_frequent', or 'constant' strategy.
- **StandardScaler.py:** Standardize features by scaling to unit variance.

### Regression

- **DecisionTreeRegressor.py:** Decision Tree based regression algorithm.
- **LinearRegression.py:** Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Linear Regression.
